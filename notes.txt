https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/premium/rules-and-filtering/operators-by-product

we can use place, place_country and some similar. There doesn't seem to be any way of filtering retweets or replies without being on a paid tier.
This can be a city, or a country. We can also restrict the language down to restrict english inputs if we need that.
We can set a start and end date.
Full_text is stored differently for retweets and tweets so we could take all, or choose only original content. we would hit the same API limit though.

Limit seems to be at 300 per 15 minutes.
We can run this every 15 minutes with different locations, and different time periods. I would ask here does time periods give us much?

pip install twarc-csv

The API itself delivers those tweets truncated, but you can find the full retweeted text inside the text field of the referenced_tweets object.
